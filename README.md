## What is Among Cubes?

Among Cubes is an online multiplayer social deduction game based on [Among Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us), initially, developed to participate in Hytopia's [Game Jam 2](https://x.com/HYTOPIAgg/status/1906753533778473265).

### How does it work

The game features two distinct teams:

1. The Impostors
   - Currently consists of one player
   - Their goal is to secretly eliminate Crew members
   - Must avoid detection while carrying out their mission

2. The Crew
   - Made up of all other players
   - Must work together to complete various tasks
   - Need to identify and vote out the Impostor before too many crew members are eliminated

The game progresses through rounds of action and discussion. When a player discovers a eliminated crew member's body or calls an emergency meeting, all players gather to discuss their suspicions. 

During these meetings, players share information, defend themselves, and ultimately vote on who they believe is the Impostor. The player with the most votes is eliminated - choose wisely, as voting out a fellow Crew member only helps the Impostor's cause!
